# Velora Room

I decided to learn 3D in web development using A-Frame.  
Since I love tidiness and virtual reality, I decided my first project would be a room!

## My room has:
- Desk  
- Art on the wall  
- Book shelf with some books  
- Empty book shelf  
- Box on the floor  
- Lamp  

## The outer space has:
- Sky  
- Grass ground  
- Sun or moon (if you toggled day/night time!)

## Interactivity:
- When you click the box on the floor, it rotates!

Here's a clean and professional version of your README formatted in Markdown for your project:
